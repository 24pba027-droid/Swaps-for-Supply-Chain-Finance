## 🚀 Try It Yourself (Judges)

**You need:** Claude Desktop (free) + the JSON file in this repo. That's it.

1. Download **[SWAPS-1LOAN-WHAT-IF-DEMO.json](https://github.com/24pba027-droid/Swaps-for-Supply-Chain-Finance/blob/main/SWAPS-1LOAN-WHAT-IF-DEMO.json)** from this repo
2. Open **Claude Desktop**
3. Drag and drop the JSON file into the Claude chat
4. Paste this prompt:

```
Please run the DRAPS supply chain tariff GTAP-based sensitivity analysis
for commodities for supply chain finance simulation for this file.
Show me the market risk factors, SOFR rates, tariff changes across time,
risk-adjusted financing rates, original loan details, a key metrics table
with total cost of loan, and compare Scenario A / B / C with swap recommendations.
```

5. Claude runs the simulation and shows you charts, tables, and the winner analysis instantly.

>## OPTION A: 
to get response from local host use these json files: 
"<path-to-your-clone>\Swaps-for-Supply-Chain-Finance\SWAPS-interface\Frontend\DEMO-SWAPS\local\supplychain-tariff

## OPTION B:
if localhost doesnot work, check your hosted files in system 32 and also try 127.0.0.1
"<path-to-your-clone>\Swaps-for-Supply-Chain-Finance\SWAPS-interface\Frontend\DEMO-SWAPS\hosted\supplychain-tariff"

> **Plain English:** DRAPS is a tool that helps SME exporters hedge against sudden tariff changes (like US-India trade tariffs) using standardized financial contracts. You run a simulation, pick a hedging strategy, and see exactly what it costs — in real numbers, not guesswork.

---

## What Problem Does DRAPS Solve?

When tariffs spike mid-contract (e.g., 50% → 60% on India textiles), a business that locked in a loan rate at the start suddenly faces much higher costs. Banks and SMEs have no standard way to hedge this — until now.

DRAPS introduces a standardized contract structure using ACTUS (the same financial contract standard trusted by the FDIC and ECB) to make tariff risk **hedgeable, machine-readable, and accessible to SMEs**.

---

## How It Works — In Simple Terms

1. **You have a trade finance loan** (e.g. $1M, 2-year, India → US, textiles)
2. **A tariff shock hits** mid-loan (e.g. goes from 50% to 60%)
3. **DRAPS runs 3 scenarios** and tells you which strategy saves you money:

| Scenario | What it means | When to use |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| **A — No Hedge** | Do nothing, absorb the cost | Baseline (worst case) |
| **B — Swap Now** | Buy protection immediately at 5% fixed | Best if shock is coming soon |
| **C — Swap Later** | Wait 3 months, pay 6% fixed | Risky — market charges you for waiting |

The simulation computes **exact cash flows** using ACTUS PAM (loan) + SWAPS contracts — no mocked data, real numbers.

---

## The Technical Ingredients

### GTAP Elasticity (σ) — the secret sauce
Each commodity has a different sensitivity to tariff shocks:

| Commodity | σ Score | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Textiles | 3.8 | Moderate — can find alternative suppliers |
| Pharmaceuticals | 2.4 | Low — hard to substitute |
| Electronics | 8.1 | Very high — easy to reroute |
| Crude Oil | 8.9 | Extremely substitutable |

Higher σ = bigger tariff transmission into your loan costs. DRAPS uses GTAP 11 data to calibrate this automatically.

### What Goes Into Each Simulation
- **SOFR** (base interest rate from US Federal Reserve)
- **Sovereign Stress** (e.g. India corridor: 50–70 bps)
- **Working Capital Stress** (30–50 bps based on trade corridor)
- **Tariff Rate** (loaded as an ACTUS Market Object — treated like an interest rate)
- **Armington Elasticity** from GTAP (determines how much the tariff transmits to your costs)

## How to Run a Simulation

### Step 1 — Prerequisites (Start ACTUS Docker Services)
Make sure **Docker Desktop** is open and running on your machine before proceeding.

Then, clone the ACTUS Risk Extension repo and run the startup script:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bala-0207/ACTUS-RISK-EXTENSION.git
cd ACTUS-RISK-EXTENSION
.\start-risk-actusservice-local.bat
```
This batch file spins up all the required ACTUS Docker services (Risk Server on `:8082` and Simulation Server on `:8083`) automatically.

If Docker is not running, the system automatically falls back to the hosted AWS server at `34.203.247.32`.

### Step 2 — Add the MCP Server to Claude Desktop
Open your Claude Desktop config file:

| OS | Path |
|----|------|
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` |

Add the `generalRisk` server entry:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "generalRisk": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "<path-to-your-clone>\\ACTUS-DeFi-Treasury-Intelligence-ADTI-\\ADTI-interface\\Backend\\dist\\mcp-server.js"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `<path-to-your-clone>` with your actual clone location.

### Step 3 — Restart Claude Desktop
Close and reopen Claude Desktop. The `ACTUS-DeFi-Treasury-Intelligence-ADTI-` MCP server will start automatically.

### Step 4 — Verify the Tools Are Available
In Claude Desktop, look for the MCP tools icon (hammer/wrench). You should see the server named `ACTUS-DeFi-Treasury-Intelligence-ADTI-` with 7 tools:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `run_simulation` | Execute ACTUS simulations (the main tool) |
| `list_simulations` | Browse available collections by domain |
| `load_simulation` | Load a specific collection file |
| `verify_portfolio` | Check stablecoin portfolio compliance |
| `get_threshold_presets` | Get EU MiCA / US GENIUS Act thresholds |
| `list_sample_portfolios` | List sample portfolio files |
| `load_sample_portfolio` | Load a sample portfolio |

When Claude calls any tool for the first time, you will see a permission prompt — click **Allow** (or **Allow for this chat**) to proceed.

### Step 5 — Run a What-If Simulation
Open Claude Desktop, upload your simulation JSON file (e.g. `SWAPS-1LOAN-WHAT-IF-DEMO.json`), then paste this prompt:

```
Please run the DRAPS supply chain tariff GTAP-based sensitivity analysis 
for commodities for supply chain finance simulation for this file and 
produce the JSON response. Show me:
- Market risk factors across time
- Base interest rates (SOFR) across time
- Export/import country, commodity, and GTAP elasticity scores
- Tariff changes across time by commodity
- Risk-adjusted financing rates across time
- Original loan details
- Key metrics table including total cost of loan accumulated
- Compare and contrast the different hedging scenarios (A/B/C) 
  with total cost and swap recommendations
```

### Step 6 — Read the Output
Claude will generate:
- Interactive charts (tariff rates, SOFR, LTV, cumulative costs)
- A comparison table across Scenario A / B / C
- A **Winner Analysis** (Scenario D) telling you which hedge saves the most
